<article class="article container container-sm padding-bottom-large"><h1 class="article-title">Uni-Testing 101</h1>
  <p class="article-meta">Apr 3, 2023</p>
  <div class="text-lead row"><div class="margin-right">tl;dr:</div>
      <div class="col-fill">Playwright docs advise writing fewer, longer tests. I follow that advice to
    its logical conclusion.
  </div></div>

  <h3></h3>

<p>I&#39;m a big advocate of unit testing and typically aim for 100% code
      coverage on anything that&#39;s going to see real use.
    </p>

    <p>Aside from improving stability, reliability, and maintainability, the
      test-writing process forces me to ask some hard-hitting questions.
    </p>

    <div class="padding-left padding-right"><p class="quote svelte-1wtwg41"><i>Does this belong here? Am I doing the same thing elsewhere? Is this
      consistent with the rest of the code?
    </i></p>
  <p class="padding-left"><small>- Me, while testing</small></p>
</div>

    <p>It&#39;s kind of like a code pre-review. It improves the codebase and my
      understanding of it.
    </p>

  <h3>Unit Testing Woes</h3>

<p>You&#39;re probably thinking,
      <i>&quot;Great! Sounds like this software quality thing is just about licked.&quot;
      </i>
      Unfortunately, such is not the case.
    </p>

    <p>After writing many thousands of unit tests and reaching 100% code coverage
      across many codebases, the same problems keep cropping up.
    </p>

    <h4>Volume</h4>

<p>The lines of code for unit tests typically outnumber those belonging to
        the module under test. Here is an example from the Jest documentation.
      </p>

      <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

      <p>That&#39;s about as simple as it gets. The corresponding test is about the
        same size yet far from comprehensive.
      </p>

      <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

    <h4>Refactoring</h4>

<p>Unit tests tend to get obliterated in refactoring. That makes sense
        because when you refactor, you&#39;re changing the units. In theory, many
        test cases should make it into the new tests. However in practice, it&#39;s
        often easier to rewrite them.
      </p>

      <p>Another problem arises specifically when testing with code coverage.
      </p>

      <div class="padding-left padding-right"><p class="quote svelte-1wtwg41"><i>You may also find yourself testing implementation details just so you
        can make sure you get that one line of code that&#39;s hard to reproduce in
        a test environment. You really want to avoid testing implementation
        details because it doesn&#39;t give you very much confidence that your
        application is working and it slows you down when refactoring.
      </i></p>
  <p class="padding-left"><small>- Kent C Dodds</small></p>
</div>

      <p>I once read that software is either in one of two states: constant
        refactoring or dying. Neither bodes particularly well for unit tests.
      </p>

    <h4>Designing for Test</h4>

<p>Writing code that is readily testable takes more time and effort than
        just getting something working. When you&#39;re prototyping, designing for
        test may not make sense and returning to make your code testable later
        can be expensive.
      </p>

    <h4>Quality</h4>

<p>We tend to treat test code as second-class and don&#39;t hold it to the same
        quality standard as production code. For example, I normally aim to keep
        my functions short and files under 200 lines whenever possible yet
        flagrantly ignore these guidelines when testing. Why? Test code is still
        code.
      </p>

    <h4>Bugs</h4>

<p>I could live with all of the above if no bugs ever made it to
        production. Many are caught, some aren&#39;t, and some seem embarrassingly
        obvious.
      </p>

  <h3>Goals</h3>

<p>These issues combined seem like a high price to pay for a partial
      solution. After accepting that no test suite could prove my program&#39;s
      correctness, I started thinking about a more pragmatic approach to testing
      and some of the qualities of an ideal test suite.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-left"><small>Optimist&#39;s Rendition of Ideal Test Suite:</small></p>

    <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

    <h4>Effective</h4>

<p>Catches bugs and improves understanding <b>initially</b> when written
        and <b>continuously</b> and as changes are made.
      </p>

    <h4>Fast</h4>

<p>Quick <b>to run</b>, the faster the better. If you&#39;re tempted to do
        something else while your tests run, you start to pay context switching
        costs.
      </p>

      <p>Quick <b>to write</b>. We prefer to spend our time changing the world
        with production code after all.
      </p>

    <h4>Maintainable</h4>

<p><b>Short</b>. Software bugs are strongly correlated with lines of code
        and there&#39;s really no reason to expect test code to be different.
      </p>

      <p><b>High quality</b>. Tests should be held to the same quality standard
        as the rest of our code. We want to be able to tell at a glance what&#39;s
        being tested and how.
      </p>

      <p><b>Decoupled</b>. Tests not depending on code being written in a
        particular way are more resilient to changes and lets you focus on
        expressing intent.
      </p>

    <h4>Low Frustration</h4>

<p><b>Reliable</b>. No false positives or negatives. It&#39;s hard to think of
        anything more frustrating for a coder than debugging an intermittent
        test failure that doesn&#39;t affect users.
      </p>

      <p><b>Targeted</b>. Introducing a bug causes a single test to fail, clearly
        indicating what the problem is.
      </p>

  <h3>What about E2E?</h3>

<p>So the brute force unit testing approach isn&#39;t enough. What about
      end-to-end testing?
    </p>

    <p>Anyone who&#39;s done any UI automation knows that special brand of
      frustration known as the flaky test. In 2014, I was consulting on a
      MeteorJS project that had hundreds of E2E tests using Selenium and
      PhantomJS. Here&#39;s the <b>git log</b> as I remember it.
    </p>

    <div class="padding-left padding-right"><pre>d8eb580 fix flaky test
f744d31 fix flaky test
f88dd2d fix flaky test
0c27836 fix flaky test
b6f8bfa fix flaky test
3e42121 fix flaky test
5e414d7 game changing feature</pre></div>

    <p>Reliability is a major concern with E2E testing; investigating false
      positives can get costly.
    </p>

    <p>Difficulty isolating failures is another concern. When a test does fail,
      how easy is it to identify the reason?
    </p>

    <p>A final concern is speed. Bringing up browsers and loading apps inevitably
      takes time.
    </p>

    <p>Fortunately, native browser support for UI automation and modern tools
      like Playwright (Trace Viewer FTW 👏) have come a long way toward
      improving reliability and identifying failures.
    </p>

    <p>So what can we do about speed?</p>

  <h3>Zero to One (hundred percent coverage)</h3>

<p>A thing we can do is reduce the number of tests. All the way down. Like,
      one test.
    </p>

    <p>From <a class=" svelte-ay64ok" href="https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Playwright Best Practices</a>:
    </p>

    <div class="padding-left padding-right padding-bottom"><p><strong>Write fewer tests but longer tests</strong></p>

      <p>When it comes to end to end testing having long tests is not a bad
        thing. It&#39;s ok to have multiple actions and assertions in your test so
        you can test complete App flows. You should avoid separating your
        assertions into individual test blocks as it doesn&#39;t really bring much
        value and just slows down the running of your tests.
      </p></div>

    <p>Here&#39;s a test exercising all of the front-end code for
      <a class=" svelte-ay64ok" href="https://venue.tube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VenueTube</a> showing real-time code coverage.
    </p>

    <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><video controls class="svelte-1yye97l"><source src="../unitest.webm" type="video/webm"><track kind="captions"></video></div>

    <h4>The Process</h4>

<p>Creating the test was relatively painless with Playwright, a bit of
        hacking, and the following process.
      </p>

      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../playwright-process.svg" alt="Process cycle diagram" class="svelte-1yye97l"></div>

      <h5>Run Test</h5>

      <p>Run the test with a custom test runner (see below). Initially just
        navigate to the home page.
      </p>

      <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

      <h5>Start Inspector</h5>

      <p>Start the Playwright Inspector (Code Generator) by appending <code>page.pause()</code> to the end of the test. The test runner shown below does so automatically.
      </p>

      <h5>Exercise Uncovered</h5>

      <p>The hardest part of the process is viewing code coverage. The easiest
        way is to write the coverage output to disk and use the <code>c8</code> package
        to generate HTML reports.
      </p>

      <p>Look for uncovered code that can be easily exercised from the current
        state. Start recording with the inspector and perform the necessary
        actions manually.
      </p>

      <h5>Add to Test</h5>

      <p>Copy the recorded steps into the test. Give complex locators clear
        variable names and look for reuse opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>Run again ensuring the new steps work and cover the targeted lines.</p>

      <h5>&lt; 100% Covered?</h5>

      <p>Repeat the cycle until everything is covered.</p>

    <h4>Test Runner</h4>

<p>Here&#39;s a simplified version of the custom test runner used in the above
        process.
      </p>

      <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

      <p>The hacking part has to do with aggregating the test coverage and
        dealing with sourcemaps. It&#39;s omitted as it could easily fill another
        post.
      </p>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>These should be no surprise to experienced E2E testers but if you spend
      most of your time on unit tests, you&#39;ll have some new challenges to
      consider.
    </p>
    <h4>Authentication</h4>

<p>Because VenueTube uses passwordless authentication, signing in took a
        bit of work. I used the <code>nodemailer</code> package to create an
        ethereal.email account that&#39;s API accessible. Then I used the
        <code>imapflow</code>
        package to get the signin email and <code>mailparser</code> to extract the
        link.
      </p>
    <h4>External APIs</h4>

<p>Firebase Authentication is one of the external APIs that the application
        sends requests to. Playwright provides a way to intercept requests and
        provide your own response. I didn&#39;t because:
      </p>

      <ol><li>I don&#39;t intend to run the test in CI (yet)</li>
        <li>Hitting the real thing is low consequence</li>
        <li>It&#39;s more realistic this way</li></ol>

      <p>I did have to simulate a webhook to complete one workflow.</p>
    <h4>Error Handling</h4>

<p>Exercising error handlers took some understanding of failure modes and a
        bit of tampering with reality. For example, to test the Sentry
        integration, I injected a script into the page to throw an exception
        (obviously none of my actual code would 😉).
      </p>

  <h3>Results</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s what the test looked like early on in the writing process.</p>

    <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

    <p>So how does this solution stack up against our ideal test suite?</p>

    <h4>Effectiveness</h4>

<p>I caught a number of bugs, found dead code, and identified some really
        bad UX in the course of writing the test which I wouldn&#39;t have with unit
        testing. That said, there are almost certainly still bugs that unit
        tests would catch.
      </p>

      <p>Whether the test catches regressions as features are added remains to be
        seen.
      </p>

    <h4>Speed</h4>

<p>It takes about 90s which is close to the upper limit of what I&#39;m likely
        to tolerate. We&#39;ll discuss opportunities to improve in a bit.
      </p>

      <p>Correcting for one-time costs (Playwright learning curve and writing the
        test runner), it took about a day to actually write the test.
      </p>

    <h4>Maintainability</h4>

<p>It&#39;s short. Around 250 lines.</p>

      <p>Because the test was so short, I wasn&#39;t too concerned about quality. I
        did assign non-obvious element selectors to clearly named variables and
        group common sequences into reusable functions.
      </p>

      <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

      <p>I didn&#39;t change any application code for the sake of the test although
        there were a few places where a different structure would be mutually
        beneficial. This indicates that the test should be resilient to
        application refactoring.
      </p>

    <h4>Frustration Factor</h4>

<p>There is definitely still some flakiness but Playwright&#39;s Trace Viewer
        really simplifies finding the cause (typically poor selector choice).
      </p>

      <p>If a Playwright command fails, it prints a debugging message and I
        explicitly log each step. However, if the failure is a real problem, it
        could take some digging through the app code to find.
      </p>

  <h3>Unexpected Wins</h3>

<p>The main motivator for this project was to get the greatest amount of test
      coverage in the shortest amount of time. While that was a success, there
      were also some unexpected benefits.
    </p>

    <h4>Retroactive Requirements</h4>

<p>VenueTube started as a <a class=" svelte-ay64ok" href="https://pipedream.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pipedream</a> script and evolved from there based on user feedback. There was never
        a formal plan or even workflow documentation.
      </p>

      <p>Finding and eliminating uncovered code was an exercise in understanding
        workflows and a good opportunity to retroactively create a requirements
        document. Even without a separate document, a well written test can
        function as a passable specification.
      </p>

      <p>The same is true of unit tests but at a lower level. An E2E test
        provides value to a wider subset of stakeholders.
      </p>

    <h4>Awkward Workflows</h4>

<p>Writing the test also helped catch cumbersome UX. Some workflows that
        seemed intuitive when written were challenging to test. In several cases
        those turned out to be real usability issues.
      </p>

      <p>For example, I noticed some vestigial code that could only be exercised
        by signing in and navigating to a specific URL. I needed to remove the
        (effectively dead) code or find a way to make it more accessible.
      </p>

    <h4>User and Developer Experience Alignment</h4>

<p>It&#39;s possible to have blazing fast unit tests and horrible application
        performance. That&#39;s not the case with E2E testing.
      </p>

      <p>Testing the entire app makes performance a pain point during
        development. Improvements benefit developers and end-users alike.
      </p>

  <h3>Caveats</h3>

<h4></h4>

<p>VenueTube is a simple monolithic app with only a few external API
        integrations. I&#39;m able to get through all existing workflows in about 90
        seconds. Your mileage may vary.
      </p>

    <h4>Test Suite Adequacy</h4>

<p>Is code coverage even a good measure of test suite adequacy? After all,
        this test yields 100% coverage for our sum function.
      </p>

      <div class="card margin-bottom-large"><div class="card-body">


<div></div></div></div>

      <p>The only information this test gives us is that <code>sum(1, 2);</code>
        doesn&#39;t throw an exception. Similarly, I didn&#39;t <code>assert</code> once.
        Instead, it relies on implicit assertions made by Playwright to proceed through
        the test. There is nothing stopping me from adding assertions but it won&#39;t
        improve code coverage.
      </p>

      <div class="padding-left padding-right"><p class="quote svelte-1wtwg41"><i>Many forms of test adequacy criteria have been tried, and will be tried
        in this world of faulty software. No one pretends that code coverage is
        perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that code coverage is the
        worst form of test adequacy criteria except for all those other forms
        that have been tried from time to time...
      </i></p>
  <p class="padding-left"><small>- Winston Churchill, probably</small></p>
</div>

      <p>Code coverage isn&#39;t perfect but I haven&#39;t found anything better. One
        non-obvious benefit is that there are two ways to increase it: add more
        tests or reduce the source lines that need testing. Targeting the latter
        can lead to a cleaner codebase.
      </p>

    <h4>100% Coverage</h4>

<p>The 100% mark is controversial and can be difficult to attain especially
        if you don&#39;t design for test from the start. I justify it with these two
        arguments:
      </p>
      <ol><li>Any other number feels (more) arbitrary</li>
        <li>Ensuring that every line of code executes seems like a low bar</li></ol>
      <p>Since V8 actually returns coverage count per line, I&#39;d even be inclined
        to go beyond 100% but need to give more thought to how that would work.
      </p>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>I&#39;m certainly not advocating the use of a single test to provide all of
      your quality assurance. That would be crazy... right?
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of the next steps I&#39;ll take to shore up my QA program.</p>

    <h4>Decomposition</h4>

<p>Splitting the test into independent workflows could improve isolation
        and reduce runtime through parallelization.
      </p>
    <h4>Database Setup</h4>

<p>Seeding the database could speed up certain workflows and reduce
        flakiness. In one case, my test started failing because randomly
        generated content contained the word &quot;Holler&quot; which is used in an
        element selector.
      </p>
    <h4>Unit Testing</h4>

<p>Complementing E2E tests with unit tests focused on especially complex or
        sensitive operations. Many low-level functions that are only lightly
        exercised here would make great unit testing candidates.
      </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you are early on in development of your app, I&#39;d recommend trying out
      uni-testing™️. It&#39;s a low-barrier way to focus on UX and catch potentially
      embarrassing issues before your users do.
    </p>

    <p>Once you get some traction, decompose the test suite into a proper test
      pyramid including integration and unit tests.
